This is an older version of PixieLib.dll which supports OS builds that are earlier than the 09/08/18 PixieLib changes. You shouldn't have it load in Unity unless you're targeting an older build on your HoloLens.

The version of ChiraAPI and PixieLib that are in the Assets/Chira/Plugins folder is always the newest version of Chira/PixieLib. Other versions just exist to retain support for old OS builds.

I'm not sure what the data of this PixieLib is (no one knows?) so I'm just calling it "01".
